W.O.M.M.P. = It "works on my machine" problem

The "works on my machine" problem 
refers to a situation where a software 
application runs without issues on a 
developer's local machine but encounters 
problems when deployed to other environments, 
such as testing or production servers. 
It is a common frustration in software 
development and can cause delays, confusion, 
and difficulties in resolving issues.

The main reasons 
behind the "works on my machine" problem are 
differences in software dependencies, 
configurations, and underlying environments 
between the developer's machine and the 
deployment environment. These differences 
can include variations in operating systems, 
library versions, system configurations, 
network setups, and more.

When a developer develops and tests an 
application on their own machine, they may
have specific configurations, libraries, or 
dependencies installed that are not replicated 
in other environments. As a result, the 
application might behave differently or 
fail to run properly when deployed to other 
systems.

The "works on my machine" problem can be mitigated 
by using tools like Docker. Docker allows developers 
to package their applications and dependencies into 
a container, ensuring that the application runs 
consistently across different environments. With 
Docker, the application and its required components 
are bundled together, reducing the chances of 
dependency or configuration mismatches.

By using Docker, developers can provide a standardized 
and reproducible environment for their applications, 
minimizing the "works on my machine" problem and promoting 
consistency in the deployment process.
